# REI

In this project, I scrape ratings data from the REI website to analyze their lineup of ski pants.  

When I completed this project in April 2019, I neglected to save the results of the web scrape for reproducibility.  Because the items listed on the website change frequently, if you were to run the R Markdown code today you'd get very different results.  Hence why I've included a pdf of the original results in the repository.
